Description: COnsole Newsreader and Emailer
 Cone is a text-based mail client. Cone seamlessly handles multiple
 POP3, IMAP accounts, and local mail folders. Cone is also a simple
 newsreader. Cone's interface is foolproof enough to be used by
 inexperienced users, but it also offers advanced features for power
 users.
 .
 Beyond others cone has support for PGP, GPG, UTF-8, IMAP, POP3,
 incoming HTML mails, external viewers, NNTP, SOCKS 5, SSL/TLS, SASL,
 LDAP and IMAP based address books, remote storable configuration,
 multiple accounts, tagging mails with several different flags, and
 SMAP (Simple Mail Access Protocol, a new IMAP and POP3 replacement
 developed by the Courier guys and supported by the Courier
 development versions).
