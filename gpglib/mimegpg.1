.SH "NAME"
mimegpg \- MIME\-GPG utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmimegpg\fR\ 'u
\fBmimegpg\fR [\-s] [\-E] [\-e] [\-c] [\-d] [\-p\ \fIn\fR] {\-\-} {gpg\ options...}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmimegpg\fR
tool signs, encrypts, or decrypts MIME\-formatted E\-mail messages using GnuPG\&.
\fBmimegpg\fR
does not contain any encryption code\&. It uses the GnuPG utility for all encryption and decryption functions\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-s\fR
option signs an E\-mail message\&. The
\fB\-E\fR
or the
\fB\-e\fR
option encrypts the E\-mail message\&. Specifying both
\fB\-E/\-e\fR
and
\fB\-s\fR
encrypts and signs the E\-mail message in a single step\&. The
\fB\-d\fR
option decrypts the message\&. The
\fB\-c\fR
option checks signatures\&.
.PP

\fBmimegpg\fR
works as a filter\&. It reads an E\-mail message from standard input, which must be a MIME\-formatted message\&.
\fBmimegpg\fR
signs, encrypts, and/or decrypts the message; then writes the encrypted, signed, or decrypted MIME message on standard output\&.
.PP
The standard input to
\fBmimegpg\fR
must be a MIME E\-mail message, with a "Mime Version: 1\&.0" header \- even if the message does not contain any attachments\&. If the message contains any attachments, they are also signed and/or encrypted, individually\&.
.PP

\fBmimegpg\fR
automatically runs GnuPG, with the required options\&.
\fBmimegpg\fR\'s options may also be followed by a single
\-\-
option; any remaining command line options are passed as additional options to GnuPG\&. The
\fB\-E/\-e\fR
option usually requires at least one
\fB\-r\fR
GnuPG option, which may be specified in this fashion\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-p\fR
option specifies a file descriptor that contains any required passphrase\&. Any other valid GnuPG options may follow a double\-dash, "\-\-", as long as it makes sense for this operation (note that
\fBmimegpg\fR
automatically adds any GnuPG options that are needed to perform the given operation)\&. The "\-\-no\-tty" option can be useful when
\fBmimegpg\fR
is used in a non\-interactive mode\&. As always, secret keys that are password\-protected secret keys cannot be used in the
\fB\-\-no\-tty\fR
mode, unless the
\fB\-p\fR
option is used\&.
.SS "SIGNING AND ENCRYPTING MESSAGES"
.PP
Use the
\fB\-s\fR
option to sign MIME message content\&. Use the
\fB\-E\fR
option to encrypt it\&. Use both options to both sign and encrypt\&. Follow with
\-\-, then any other GnuPG options\&. The
\fB\-E\fR
option will require at least one
\fB\-r\fR
GnuPG option\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-E\fR
option encapsulates the message content and all the attachments into a single encrypted MIME object\&. Some mail software cannot handle encapsulated content\&. The
\fB\-e\fR
option encrypts each attachment separately, without encapsulation\&.
.PP
If a secret key used for signing is password protected, the prompt to enter the password will be issued directly by GnuPG\&. Note that the
\fB\-s\fR
and the
\fB\-e\fR
(but not
\fB\-E\fR) options may issue multiple password prompts in interactive mode\&.
\fBmimegpg\fR
runs GnuPG multiple times if the MIME message contains attachments\&. GnuPG will be invoked separately for each attachment in the MIME message, and each invocation will prompt for any required key password\&. Note that the initial message headers are not signed and/or encrypted, except for the MIME headers themselves\&. However, any
message/rfc822
MIME content \- attached messages \- are encrypted/signed in their entirety, headers and content\&.
.SS "DECRYPTING AND CHECKING SIGNATURES"
.PP
The
\fB\-d\fR
option attempts to decrypt any encrypted content in a MIME message\&. The
\fB\-c\fR
option attempts to verify signatures of any signed content\&. Both
\fB\-c\fR
and
\fB\-d\fR
can be specified at the same time\&.
\fB\-d\fR
looks for any
multipart/encrypted
MIME content, then attempts to decrypt it\&.
\fB\-c\fR
looks for any
multipart/signed
MIME content, then attempts to verify the signature\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-c\fR
and
\fB\-d\fR
options replace the
multipart/signed
and
multipart/encrypted
MIME content with a
multipart/x\-mimepgp
section, that contains an additional attribute called "xpgpstatus"\&. The value of the attribute is set to the exit code of GnuPG\&. Succesfully decrypting the message and/or verifying the signature sets the exit code to 0\&. A non\-zero exit code indicates that the signature could not be verified, or the message could not be decrypted\&.
.PP
The first section in this
multipart/x\-mimepgp
is a
text/plain
section that contains any messages from GnuPG\&. The second section is any decrypted or signed content\&.
\fBmimegpg\fR
will include the signed content even if the signature could not be verified (check
xpgpstatus)\&. Encrypted content that could not be decrypted will not be included (obviously)\&.
.PP
Note \- any existing x\-mimegpg MIME section will have its content\-type quietly reset to multipart/mixed, in order to avoid confusion (except when this is what got decrypted)\&.
