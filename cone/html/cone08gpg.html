    <p><span class="application">Cone</span> includes supports for
    encryption and digital signatures. <span class="application">GnuPG</span> (http://www.gnupg.org) must be
    installed in order to use encryption and digital
    signatures.</p>

    <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
      <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

      <p><span class="application">Cone</span> uses a newer
      MIME-based format for encrypted and signed messages.
      <span class="application">Cone</span> does not recognize or
      use the older &#8220;<span class="quote">inline-formatted</span>&#8221; messages (this is
      where the text messages contain keywords like
      &#8220;<span class="quote">BEGIN PGP SIGNED

      </div>

      <p>At this time <span class="application">Cone</span>
      provides basic encryption, decryption, signature creation,
      and signature verification functionality. Key management
      (like creating and signing keys) must still be done with
      <span class="application">GnuPG</span>.</p>

        </div>

        <p>When <span class="application">GnuPG</span> is
        installed, two additional options become available after
        pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>CTRL</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>X</strong></span> to send a message:</p>

        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt><span class="term">Sign</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> displays a list of
              all available secret keys. Highlight the key and
              press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> to select a
              key for signing the message. The list of keys is
              shown at the bottom of the screen. The top of the
              screen shows additional information about the
              currently highlighted key.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">Encrypt</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span> displays a list of
              all known public keys. More than one public key may
              be selected. All public keys whose addresses match
              any recipient address, or the sender's address, are
              selected by default. The message is encrypted by all
              chosen public keys. Highlight each key and press
              <span class="keycap"><strong>SPACE</strong></span> to
              select a public key encryption. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> after
              selecting all public keys. A checkmark (or an
              asterisk, depending on the console display) is placed
              next to each selected key. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>SPACE</strong></span> again in order
              to un-select a selected key.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>

        <p>The original prompt is updated accordingly, after
        selecting either of these two options (the original
        &#8220;<span class="quote">Send message?</span>&#8221;
        prompt changes to a &#8220;<span class="quote">Sign, then
        send message?</span>&#8221;, or some other appropriate
        variant). The key used for signing a message is memorized
        like any other custom message header, and is automatically
        selected by default when sending the next message. Choose
        &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span>ign</span>&#8221; again
        to un-select the key. A separate default signing key exists
        for every account <span class="application">Cone</span> is
        logged on to, and a default signing key is memorized for
        every open folder. It is possible to memorize a different
        key for signing replies to messages in different folders.
        However that may prove to be a bit cumbersome. Each time a
        message in a different folder is replied to, <span class="application">Cone</span> will prompt whether to set that
        folder's key (or any other custom header) as the default
        for the entire mail account. This feature is probably
        convenient when most replies are to messages from the same
        folder, and messages from other folders are accessed
        infrequently.</p>

          selecting &#8220;<span class="quote">Delivery
          notifications</span>&#8221;. After selecting
          &#8220;<span class="quote">Delivery
          notifications</span>&#8221;, the only remaining options
          shown are the various delivery notifications options, and

          sends the message.</p>

          <p>Copies of encrypted sent messages are saved in their
          encrypted form. Unless the sender's public key is also
          selected for encryption, the sender will not be able to
          read a copy of the sender's own message!</p>

        <p><span class="application">Cone</span> supports
        passphrase-protected keys. <span class="application">Cone</span> prompts for a passphrase before
        it signs a message. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> without entering
        anything if the key does not have a passphrase.</p>

        <p><span class="application">Cone</span> remembers the
        passphrase, and will not ask for it again. When a master
        single-signon password is installed (see
        &#8220;<span class="quote">Master Passwords</span>&#8221;),
        passphrase passwords are also saved together with all other
        account passwords. <span class="application">Cone</span>
        does not automatically know when, and if, the key's
        passphrase is changed. When message signing fails,
        <span class="application">Cone</span> automatically removes
        the saved passphrase. Simply try again to sign the same
        message, and <span class="application">Cone</span> will
        prompt for the new passphrase.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span>
        (as in &#8220;<span class="quote">decr<span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span>t</span>&#8221;) attempts
        to decrypt or verify the signature of a currently opened
        message. The message must be opened before it can be
        decrypted. A signed message must also be opened, before its
        signature can be verified.</p>

        <p>An encrypted message will initially be empty, naturally,
        except for a single attachment that contains the encrypted
        content. The contents of a signed message are displayed
        normally. The presence of an additional attachment, that
        contains the message's signature, indicates that the
        message is signed. After a message is succesfully
        decrypted, or its signature is verified, the message's
        contents are shown together with the diagnostic messages
        from <span class="application">GnuPG</span> which contain
        additional information on the message's encryption
        status.</p>

        <p>Forwarding or replying to a message always ends up
        forwarding or replying whatever's currently shown on the
        screen. If the message is decrypted, the decrypted contents
        are forwarded. If the message is not decrypted, its
        original encrypted version is forwarded.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Before decrypting a message, <span class="application">Cone</span> prompts for a passphrase. The
        passphrase is memorized just like passphrases are memorized
        after a message is signed, and <span class="application">Cone</span> will not ask for a passphrase
        again. Just like when signing, when a master single-signon
        password is installed, the passphrase is saved together
        with all other account passwords.</p>

        <p>At this time, <span class="application">Cone</span> is
        not smart enough to known which private key was used for
        encrypting a message. Therefore if multiple private keys
        are present, they all should have the same passphrase.
        Otherwise, each time an attempt is made to decrypt a
        message that's encrypted by different key, the attempt will
        fail because the wrong passphrase was memorized. Each time
        an attempt to decrypt a message fails, <span class="application">Cone</span> automatically forgets the saved
        passphrase, so that the attempt to decrypt the message can
        be tried again, this time entering the correct passphrase
        (which will now be memorized and used as a default
        decrypting passphrase from now on).</p>
