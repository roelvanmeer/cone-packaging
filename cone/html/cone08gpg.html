keys.
A checkmark (or an asterisk, depending on the console display) is placed

>The original prompt is updated accordingly, after selecting either of these
two options (the original <SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Sign, then send message?"</SPAN
>, or some other appropriate
variant).
The key used for signing a message is memorized like any other custom
message header, and is automatically selected by default when sending the
next message.
Choose <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>S</B

A separate default signing key exists for every account <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> is logged on to,
and a default signing key is memorized for every open folder.
It is possible to memorize a different key for signing
replies to messages in different folders.
However that may prove to be a bit cumbersome.
Each time a message in a different folder is replied to, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> will prompt
whether to set that folder's key (or any other custom header) as the default
for the entire mail account.
This feature is probably convenient when most replies are to messages from
the same folder, and messages from other folders are accessed
infrequently.</P

The message must be opened before it can be decrypted.
A signed message must also be opened, before its signature can be

attachment that contains the encrypted content.
The contents of a signed message are displayed normally.
The presence of an additional attachment, that contains the message's
signature, indicates that the message is signed.
After a message is succesfully decrypted, or its signature is verified,
the message's contents are shown together with the diagnostic messages from

the message's encryption status.</P

The passphrase is memorized just like passphrases are memorized after

Just like when signing, when a master single-signon password is installed,
the passphrase is saved together with all other account passwords.</P

used for encrypting a message.  Therefore if multiple private keys are present,
they all should have the same passphrase.
Otherwise, each time an attempt is made to decrypt a message that's encrypted
by different key, the attempt will fail because the wrong passphrase was
memorized.
Each time an attempt to decrypt a message fails, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT

the saved passphrase, so that the attempt to decrypt the message can be
tried again, this time entering the correct passphrase (which will now be
memorized and used as a default decrypting passphrase from now on).</P
