>The threaded view works best on UTF-8 consoles. It is also not very well suited
for machines with limited resources.
Computing a threaded view is expensive, and the threaded view needs to
be recomputed whenever messages are added or

is much faster, and gives similar results.</P

><P
>Thread watching is designed primarily to be used with NetNews newsgroups.
The mechanism by which replies are selected for watching is quick, and simple.
NetNews messages typically carry robust threading metadata,
and even if there's a NetNews hiccup, and messages come in out of order,
all eligible replies should
still be correctly selected for watching.
There is a very small chance that a very severe NetNews
disruption will result in a failure to catch watched
replies.
However, messages would probably come in so wildly out of sequence that the
thread is not likely to remain readable even if all watched replies were
properly tagged, whenever they arrive.</P
><P
>Thread watching is not limited to NetNews newsgroups.
E-mail threads may also be selected for watching.
However, E-mail messages tend to have far less threading metadata than their
NetNews counterparts.
A disruption in incoming E-mail is more likely to result in missed replies,
than a NetNews disruption.
However, E-mail disruptions, on average, tend to occur far less often than
NetNews disruptions, so everything tends to come out even.</P
><P
>Additionally, many modern E-mail clients now include the same
full threading metadata as NetNews clients (<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> always includes complete
threading metadata with every outgoing message, NetNews or E-mail).
This issue continues to be less and less relevant,
as time goes on.</P

><P
>The semantics of checking for new mail varies slightly, depending on the
mail account.
With SMAP-based mail account, and with most IMAP mail accounts, new mail in
the current folder is shown immediately.
If messages in the folder are shown in the order they were added to the folder,
new mail will naturally appear at the end of folder.
If messages are shown in a different sorting order, new messages will be
shown wherever they should appear in accordance with the current sort
order.
Most IMAP mail accounts show new mail as soon as it is received.
Some IMAP mail accounts do not report new mail immediately after it is
delivered to the mail folder (this depends on the IMAP server software).
<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> checks for new mail at regular intervals, and new received messages
will show up after the next check for new mail.</P
><P
>New mail delivered to a local mbox folder will usually be shown when
<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> checks for new mail, at regularly-scheduled intervals.
New mail delivered to a local maildir will also usually appear only after
<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> checks for new mail.
On most Linux and SGI systems, and on any other system that has the File
Access Monitor daemon running, new mail will be reported immediately.</P
><P
>In all cases, move to the last message in the folder, and use the
cursor down key to have <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> explicitly checks for new mail.
New mail in a POP3 folder will only be shown after an explicit
new mail check (<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> does not check for new mail in POP3 folders by
itself).</P
><P
>In all cases, new mail will not be immediately shown after the folder
index screen is closed.
When the folder index
screen is closed, the mail folder still remains <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"opened"</SPAN
>
until <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> opens another folder in the same mail account.
<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> still regularly checks for new mail when the folder index screen
is not being shown (except for POP3 accounts).
New mail will be reported only when <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> checks for new mail, or when
the folder index screen is reopened.</P

>Most mail accounts allow the same folder to be opened by multiple
applications.
When <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> has a folder opened, another application might also have the
same folder opened, and another application may be making changes to the
folder, at the same time.</P
><P
>Generally speaking, new mail delivered to the folder, while it's opened by
<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
>, is one example of concurrent changes to the contents of the folder
while it is opened.  Other applications may make other kinds of
changes to the folder's contents: changing a message's status
(whether the message is unread, deleted, replied, tagged, and/or flagged);
or removing a message from the folder.
In general, changes by other applications are reported in the
same manner that <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> reports new mail.
If <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> reports new mail as soon as it is received, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> will also
report other kinds of changes to the folder's contents as soon as they occur.
Otherwise, changes to the folder's contents are reported the next time
<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cone</TT
> checks for new mail.
An attempt to access a message that was removed by another application,
but not yet reported, usually results in an error.</P
