    <p>Highlighting a folder on the folder listing screen and
    pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span>
    shows an index of messages in the folder. <span class="application">Cone</span> shows the following information for
    each message:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>The message number, starting from 1 and counting
          upwards. New messages (unread messages), are prefixed
          with by &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">N</code></span>&#8221;. Messages marked for
          deletion are prefixed by &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">D</code></span>&#8221;. On
          some terminals, new messages are prefixed by a little
          diamond symbol, and messages are marked for deletion by a
          crosscheck symbol. Messages that have been replied to are
          prefixed by &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">R</code></span>&#8221;.</p>

          <p><span class="application">Cone</span> can process
          groups of messages at once (for example: deleting or
          moving a group of messages to another folder). This is
          done by &#8220;<span class="quote">flagging</span>&#8221;
          each message, individually, then executing the command.
          Each flagged message is marked with an asterisk,
          &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">*</code></span>&#8221;. On some displays,
          flagged messages are identified by a checkmark symbol,
          instead of the asterisk.</p>

          <p>The date or time when the message was sent or
          received. Only the date is shown for messages sent or
          received over a week ago. More recent messages have their
          day and time shown.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The sender's or recipient's name. Messages sent to
          multiple people have only the first recipient shown.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The approximate size of the message.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The message's subject. There's not a lot of room to
          show the message's subject; <span class="application">Cone</span> shows as much of a subject as
          possible.</p>

          <p>Messages that belong to a watched thread, or a
          subthread, have the &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&#8801;</code></span>&#8221;
          &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&#8226;</code></span>&#8221; character shown,
          in reverse colors, in front of the message's subject.
          Terminals that cannot display these symbols will use the
          &#8220;<span class="quote">o</span>&#8221; and
          &#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221; characters

      <p>The highlighted message on this screen designates the
      current message. Move the cursor using the cursor up/down
      keys, <span class="keycap"><strong>PgUp</strong></span>, and
      <span class="keycap"><strong>PgDn</strong></span>. The cursor
      left/right keys move the cursor to the previous/next flagged
      message. After running a search with the <span class="keycap"><strong>;</strong></span> command (see below), use
      the cursor left/right keys to locate the messages found by
      the search.</p>

      <p><span class="keycap"><strong>L</strong></span> or the
      <span class="keycap"><strong>&lt;</strong></span> returns to
      the folder listing screen, or use the following keys:</p>

            <p>Search messages, flag them, then do something to all
            flagged messages, at once. Additional options will be

            below.</p>

            <p>Change the order the messages are shown on this
            screen. Initially, the messages are shown in the order
            they were added to the folder. Use this option to set
            the available sorting order: <span class="keycap"><strong>A</strong></span> - in the order they
            were added to the folder (default); <span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span> - order by each
            message's sent date; <span class="keycap"><strong>N</strong></span> - order messages by
            sender's (or the recipient's) name; <span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> - order messages by
            their subject; <span class="keycap"><strong>T</strong></span> - order messages by
            threads.</p>

            <p>The threaded view works best on UTF-8 consoles. It
            is also not very well suited for machines with limited
            resources. Computing a threaded view is expensive, and
            the threaded view needs to be recomputed whenever
            messages are added or removed from the folder. Machines
            with limited resources should use a subject-based sort,
            which is much faster, and gives similar results.</p>

            <span class="application">Cone</span> may ask a few
            questions before creating a reply. <span class="application">Cone</span> knows how to format replies
            in three different ways. Not every format reply is

            <p>Proper selection of a reply format is only possible

            a submenu where a message may be &#8220;<span class="quote">tagged</span>&#8221;. Tagged messages are shown
            with a different background color. This is merely a
            visual aid for highlighting selected messages, and
            nothing more. A color-capable display is necessary for
            showing tagged messages.</p>

            <p>The submenu lists nine available tags, selected by
            pressing a digit <span class="keycap"><strong>1</strong></span> through <span class="keycap"><strong>9</strong></span>. <span class="keycap"><strong>0</strong></span> removes the existing
            tag on the current message. The colors for the tags are
            selected from those available on the current display.
            Some tags will share the same color if the current
            display has less than nine available colors, in
            addition to the default text color.</p>

            <p>The names of each tag may be set by choosing the

            selection from <span class="application">Cone</span>'s
            main menu. The default names of the first five tags are
            the same as message labels used by the Mozilla mail
            client. With most IMAP servers <span class="application">Cone</span> and Mozilla will see each
            other's tagged/labeled messages (however <span class="application">Cone</span>'s colors are determined by
            the console's color palette, and may not necessary
            match the ones Mozilla uses for the same label). This
            requires additional IMAP server functionality that may
            not be implemented by some IMAP servers.</p>

            <p>Plain text attachments may be viewed individually,

            <p>When <span class="application">GnuPG</span> is
            installed, highlighting an attachment that contains
            GPG/PGP keys and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span> imports the
            keys. <span class="application">Cone</span> prompts for
            a confirmation, then runs <span class="application">GnuPG</span> to import the attached keys.
            Some versions of <span class="application">Gnu</span>
            require a special procedure for importing private keys.
            <span class="application">Cone</span>'s prompt has an
            explicit private key export option. With other versions
            of <span class="application">GnuPG</span> this option

            checks for any unfinished messages in the Draft folder,
            before opening this screen. If the Draft folder
            contains any messages, <span class="application">Cone</span> offers an option to resume
            writing an unfinished message, instead of starting a

            <span class="application">Cone</span> is interrupted,

            interrupted message, and prompts to resume writing the
            interrupted message. An interrupted message must be
            opened and either: sent, explicitly cancelled, or saved
            in the Draft folder; before another message can be

              <p>Efficient searching is implemented for local mail,
              and IMAP/SMAP mailboxes only. NetNews servers'
              searching capabilities are very limited, and POP3
              servers have no search facilities whatsoever. In all
              cases, searching for message status flags is
              supported, since message status flags are always
              cached locally.</p>

              <p>Only message headers of NetNews folders may be
              searched, and only English characters can be used as
              a search string. Some older NetNews servers may not
              have any searching ability whatsoever. Searching of
              message contents is not supported. Searching by
              message size, or message's date is not supported
              either.</p>

              <p>Searching of POP3 folders is also not very
              efficient, although the search text is not limited to
              English characters only. POP3 folder search is
              accomplished by downloading the complete headers of
              each message, and searching it manually. Downloaded
              headers are not cached. The headers are also
              downloaded when searching by message's date.
              Searching by message size, or message's date is not
              supported for POP3 folders.</p>

        &#8220;<span class="quote">o</span>&#8221; character on

        also be automatically marked in the same fashion.</p>

          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

          <p>Any existing replies to the watched message are not
          automatically marked. Only future replies to the message
          will be automatically marked for watching.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Thread-watching is mostly useful with large NetNews
        newsgroups. A single, watched, conversation thread can be
        easily identified even in a very active newsgroup; however
        thread-watching can also be used with regular mail folders
        (with some limitations as noted below).</p>

        <p>NetNews threads are famous for quickly diverging
        off-topic, so <span class="application">Cone</span>'s
        thread-watching future quietly turns itself off, after a
        while. There's very little uses in continuing to monitor a
        thread that began talking about the merits of organic food,
        but then ended up becoming a heated discussion about
        psychological problems of the Hollywood elite.</p>

        <p>The initial default settings will watch for replies for
        up to fourteen days, or five levels of follow-ups,
        whichever comes first. That meaning that a reply to a reply
        to a reply to a reply to a reply of a watched message will
        still be shown as part of a watched thread, but its own
        reply will not be. There is no limit on the number of
        watched replies to the initial message, or to any of the
        five subsequent levels of follow-ups, as long as they
        arrive within the time-enforced limit.</p>

        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

          <p>After coming back from a 15-day vacation, and opening
          a folder which used to have watched threads, none of the
          new messages will be marked for watching, even though
          they arrived before the 14-days were up. Well, you just
          had a nice 15-day vacation, why do you care about some
          stale flame war that started more than two weeks ago?</p>
        </div>

        <p>The last level of watched followups will be marked with
        a different character, a &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&#8226;</code></span>&#8221;
        (or &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">*</code></span>&#8221; as shown by some
        terminals), instead of the &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&#8801;</code></span>&#8221;
        character. This is a visual cue to evaluate whether this
        subthread is still worth following. If so, the message can
        be manually re-watched. Highlighting the message and
        choosing this option will &#8220;<span class="quote">renew</span>&#8221; the interest in this thread for
        another round of followups (however other branches of the
        original thread will still expire as usual, unless they are
        also renewed).</p>

        <p>Selecting this option again on a message that's already
        being watched will prompt to turn off watching for more
        replies. The message will no longer appear watched, and any
        future replies to the message will not be watched.</p>

          <p>Thread watching is designed primarily to be used with
          NetNews newsgroups. The mechanism by which replies are
          selected for watching is quick, and simple. NetNews
          messages typically carry robust threading metadata, and
          even if there's a NetNews hiccup, and messages come in
          out of order, all eligible replies should still be
          correctly selected for watching. There is a very small
          chance that a very severe NetNews disruption will result
          in a failure to catch watched replies. However, messages
          would probably come in so wildly out of sequence that the
          thread is not likely to remain readable even if all
          watched replies were properly tagged, whenever they
          arrive.</p>

          <p>Thread watching is not limited to NetNews newsgroups.
          E-mail threads may also be selected for watching.
          However, E-mail messages tend to have far less threading
          metadata than their NetNews counterparts. A disruption in
          incoming E-mail is more likely to result in missed
          replies, than a NetNews disruption. However, E-mail
          disruptions, on average, tend to occur far less often
          than NetNews disruptions, so everything tends to come out
          even.</p>

          <p>Additionally, many modern E-mail clients now include
          the same full threading metadata as NetNews clients (
          <span class="application">Cone</span> always includes
          complete threading metadata with every outgoing message,
          NetNews or E-mail). This issue continues to be less and
          less relevant, as time goes on.</p>

      <div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The semantics of checking for new mail varies slightly,
        depending on the mail account. With SMAP-based mail
        account, and with most IMAP mail accounts, new mail in the
        current folder is shown immediately. If messages in the
        folder are shown in the order they were added to the
        folder, new mail will naturally appear at the end of
        folder. If messages are shown in a different sorting order,
        new messages will be shown wherever they should appear in
        accordance with the current sort order. Most IMAP mail
        accounts show new mail as soon as it is received. Some IMAP
        mail accounts do not report new mail immediately after it
        is delivered to the mail folder (this depends on the IMAP
        server software). <span class="application">Cone</span>
        checks for new mail at regular intervals, and new received
        messages will show up after the next check for new
        mail.</p>

        <p>New mail delivered to a local mbox folder will usually
        be shown when <span class="application">Cone</span> checks
        for new mail, at regularly-scheduled intervals. New mail
        delivered to a local maildir will also usually appear only
        after <span class="application">Cone</span> checks for new
        mail. On most Linux and SGI systems, and on any other
        system that has the File Access Monitor daemon running, new
        mail will be reported immediately.</p>

        <p>In all cases, move to the last message in the folder,
        and use the cursor down key to have <span class="application">Cone</span> explicitly checks for new mail.
        New mail in a POP3 folder will only be shown after an
        explicit new mail check ( <span class="application">Cone</span> does not check for new mail in
        POP3 folders by itself).</p>

        <p>In all cases, new mail will not be immediately shown
        after the folder index screen is closed. When the folder
        index screen is closed, the mail folder still remains
        &#8220;<span class="quote">opened</span>&#8221; until
        <span class="application">Cone</span> opens another folder
        in the same mail account. <span class="application">Cone</span> still regularly checks for new
        mail when the folder index screen is not being shown
        (except for POP3 accounts). New mail will be reported only
        when <span class="application">Cone</span> checks for new
        mail, or when the folder index screen is reopened.</p>

      <div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

              <h5 class="title"><a id="id371136" shape="rect" name="id371136"> </a>Concurrent changes to the current
              folder's contents</h5>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Most mail accounts allow the same folder to be opened by
        multiple applications. When <span class="application">Cone</span> has a folder opened, another
        application might also have the same folder opened, and
        another application may be making changes to the folder, at
        the same time.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, new mail delivered to the folder,
        while it's opened by <span class="application">Cone</span>,
        is one example of concurrent changes to the contents of the
        folder while it is opened. Other applications may make
        other kinds of changes to the folder's contents: changing a
        message's status (whether the message is unread, deleted,
        replied, tagged, and/or flagged); or removing a message
        from the folder. In general, changes by other applications
        are reported in the same manner that <span class="application">Cone</span> reports new mail. If <span class="application">Cone</span> reports new mail as soon as it is
        received, <span class="application">Cone</span> will also
        report other kinds of changes to the folder's contents as
        soon as they occur. Otherwise, changes to the folder's
        contents are reported the next time <span class="application">Cone</span> checks for new mail. An attempt
        to access a message that was removed by another
        application, but not yet reported, usually results in an
        error.</p>
