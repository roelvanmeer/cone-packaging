    <p>This is the first screen that comes up after starting
    <span class="application">Cone</span>. This screen lists all
    configured mail accounts. After starting, <span class="application">Cone</span> automatically opens the first
    configured mail account, prompting for a password if necessary.
    <span class="application">Cone</span> is capable of handling
    multiple mail accounts, and any additional configured mail
    accounts are initially closed. To open one of the other mail
    account, highlight it with the cursor and press <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span>.</p>

    <p>When a mail account is opened, <span class="application">Cone</span> lists the default set of folders in
    the mail account. Folders that contain other subfolders,
    instead of messages, are prefixed by a &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">+</code></span>&#8221;, or a
    &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&#8594;</code></span>&#8221; (depending on the
    display). Certain mail servers may have folders that contain
    both messages and subfolders. Those so-called
    &#8220;<span class="quote">hybrid</span>&#8221; folders are
    prefixed by a &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">*</code></span>&#8221;, or a &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&#8226;</code></span>&#8221;
    (depending on the display).</p>

    <p>Move the cursor to highlight a folder and press <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span> to display its contents
    (either an index of messages in the folder; or a list of the
    folder's subfolders). Use <span class="keycap"><strong>+</strong></span> to display subfolders of a
    hybrid folder, use <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span> to display the index of
    messages in a hybrid folder.</p>

    <p>Move the cursor to highlight a folder with displayed
    subfolders and press <span class="keycap"><strong>-</strong></span> to remove its subfolders
    from display.</p>

    <p>Some mail accounts will display the number of messages in
    each folder, automatically. Sometimes the number of messages in
    a mail folder cannot be quickly determined, so <span class="application">Cone</span> will not bother to show the folder's
    size. Message counts are automatically shown for:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>Mail stored in local maildir folders.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Mail stored on most remote POP3 and IMAP servers.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Message counts are not automatically shown for:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>Mail stored in local mailbox files.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Mail stored on some IMAP servers.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Sometimes <span class="application">Cone</span> cannot
    correctly determine whether the IMAP server provides message
    counts quickly. Use the &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">/slowstatus</code></span>&#8221; or the
    &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">/faststatus</code></span>&#8221; flag when creating
    the new mail account to specify whether <span class="application">Cone</span> should automatically show message
    counts for displayed folders.</p>

    <p>When <span class="application">Cone</span> runs for the very
    first time, <span class="application">Cone</span> creates a
    mail account that contains local mail folders. Use the main
    menu screen to add additional mail accounts. Here's an example
    of the &#8220;<span class="quote">Folder Listing</span>&#8221;
    screen:</p>

      <p>The bottom two lines of the screen lists the available
      &#8220;<span class="quote">hotkeys</span>&#8221;, and their
      corresponding actions. &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">^</code></span>&#8221;
      indicates that <span class="keycap"><strong>CTRL</strong></span> should be held down
      while pressing the following key. On this screen, for
      example, press and hold <span class="keycap"><strong>CTRL</strong></span>, then press and release
      <span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span> to invoke the
      &#8220;<span class="quote">Move down</span>&#8221; action
      (described below).</p>

      <p>Screens with more &#8220;<span class="quote">hotkeys</span>&#8221; that can fit on the screen will
      use <span class="keycap"><strong>CTRL</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>O</strong></span> to cycle through the
      complete &#8220;<span class="quote">hotkey</span>&#8221;
      listing.</p>

      <p>As shown in the illustration above, <span class="application">Cone</span> lists the hierarchy of available
      folders in a natural, tree-like format. The list of folders
      in each mail account begins with a list called
      &#8220;<span class="quote">top-level folders</span>&#8221;;
      the <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span> and
      <span class="keycap"><strong>+</strong></span> keys will then
      display the contents of each folder.</p>

      <p>When a new mail account is configured, <span class="application">Cone</span> creates a default list of
      &#8220;<span class="quote">top-level folders</span>&#8221;,
      as follows:</p>

      <div class="variablelist">

        <p>Opening a NetNews (Usenet) account displays four
        entries:</p>

        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt><span class="term">All Newsgroups</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This entry opens a hierarchical listing of all
              available newsgroups, subscribed and unsubscribed.
              Highlight a newsgroup with the cursor and press
              <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span> to
              subscribe and open the newsgroup for the first

            <dd>
              <p>This entry opens a list of all recently created
              newsgroups.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">Refresh newsgroup
            list</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Highlight this entry with the cursor and press
              <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span> to
              download and save the server's entire list of
              available newsgroups. This process may take a long
              time. On low bandwidth connections it may take 15-20
              minutes, depending on the number of newsgroups
              carried by the server.</p>

              <p>Sometimes servers may not correctly report
              newly-created newsgroups, so using this option will
              be necessary in order to add the new groups to "All
              newsgroups". Additionally, this is the only way to
              remove newsgroups no longer carried by the server
              from "All newsgroups".</p>
            </dd>

            <dd>
              <p>This entry contains a list of subscribed
              newsgroups. To subscribe to a newsgroup, find it
              under "All newsgroups" and open it. This action
              automatically subscribes the newsgroup. To
              unsubscribe a newsgroup, highlight it here, then
              press <span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span>
              (Delete).</p>

              <p>Another way to subscribe to a newsgroup is
              described in the following section.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="title"><a id="id349325" shape="rect" name="id349325"> </a>Adding top-level folders</h5>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>There are two ways to manually insert additional folders
        into the top-level list. The easiest way is to highlight an
        existing folder, then press <span class="keycap"><strong>U</strong></span>, then <span class="keycap"><strong>T</strong></span>. This folder is now
        included in the top-level folder list. It is important to
        note that the actual mail folder is not renamed, or
        otherwise moved in the mail account, it is only shown as
        part of the default top-level folder hierarchy. The
        top-level entry for this folder can be thought of as a
        &#8220;<span class="quote">shortcut</span>&#8221; to the
        folder. If the original folder is located deep in the mail
        account's folder hierarchy, it is no longer necessary to
        dive deep into the hierarchy each time the mail account is
        opened, in order to reach the folder; it's going to be
        right there, in the top-level folder hierarchy.</p>

        <p>Top-level folders do no appear in their original
        location in the mail account's folder hierarchy. When the
        folder is first added to the top-level folder list it
        momentarily appears twice: in its actual location, on the
        screen, and at the topmost level. After its original
        hierarchy folder level is closed, it will no longer appear.
        As noted above, the folder is still there, it just appears
        as a shortcut at the topmost level. When the shortcut is
        removed (see the next section), the folder reappears in its
        place.</p>

        <p>The second way to create top-level folder shortcuts is
        to highlight the name of the mail account with the cursor,
        then press <span class="keycap"><strong>A</strong></span>
        (Add). <span class="application">Cone</span> shows the
        following prompt: &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">Add folder/directory in</code> <em class="replaceable"><code>account</code></em></span>&#8221;.
        Enter the complete folder name, as used by the mail
        account's server. This method for adding top-level folders
        requires some knowledge of the folder's location on the
        mail server. However it can be used to add folders that are
        outside of the currently-configured folder hierarchies
        (which is sometimes the case with IMAP servers), as
        follows:</p>

        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt><span class="term">IMAP folders</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>The folder name is used as is. This means that
              folders whose names contain characters that are not
              in the application's character set, or do not follow
              the IMAP modified <code class="literal">UTF-7</code>
              folder name encoding, cannot be entered.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">SMAP folders</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Specify the complete folder path name. Use the
              forward slash character, &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">/</code></span>&#8221;
              to separate names of individual folders in the
              <code class="literal">SMAP</code> folder hierarchy.
              Unicode/ISO-10646 characters that cannot be
              represented in the application's character set may be
              specified as &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">%</code><em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em><code class="literal">;</code></span>&#8221;, where <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> is a decimal
              Unicode value. Use &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">\/</code></span>&#8221;
              to specify a forward slash character in the folder
              name, &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">\\</code></span>&#8221; to specify a
              backslash character, and &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">\%</code></span>&#8221;
              to specify the &#8220;<span class="quote">%</span>&#8221; character.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">Usenet (NetNews)
            newsgroups</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Usenet accounts already have a dedicated link to
              subscribed newsgroups. For Usenet accounts, this
              process is used to subscribe to a new newsgroup which
              does not appear under "All newsgroups".</p>

              <p>It is not possible for NetNews (Usenet) readers to
              maintain a correct, accurate list of available
              newsgroups. Usenet readers must download a list of
              available newsgroups, which can be quite large and
              require a significant time to download. It's not
              feasible to do this every time. As such, Usenet
              readers keep a saved copy of the download newsgroup
              list. Upon request, the newsgroup list may be
              downloaded again, and the locally saved list is
              brought up to date. This is what "Refresh newsgroup
              list" does.</p>

              <p>"Check for new newsgroups" is a partial solution
              that's supported by most Usenet news servers, and can
              usually do the trick and download recently added
              newsgroups. There's no way to remove newsgroups no
              longer carried by the server, except by using
              "Refresh newsgroup list", but at least "Check for new
              newsgroups" will do the trick and include new groups
              under "All newsgroups", so that they can be
              subscribed to.</p>

              <p>However, sometimes "Refresh newsgroup list" might
              not work with some oddball news server, or the news
              server can accidentally lose its wits and "forget"
              which new newsgroups were added, recently. In any
              case, use the process for creating a top-level folder
              in order to manually subscribe to a newsgroup. Type
              in the newsgroup's name, carefully checking for the
              correct spelling. After creating a link, open it and

          are limited in the combination of access rights that may

          implement version 1 of the access control list protocol
          can only assign the &#8220;<span class="quote">Delete/undelete messages</span>&#8221;,
          &#8220;<span class="quote">Expunge deleted
          messages</span>&#8221;, and &#8220;<span class="quote">Delete folder</span>&#8221; together as a group.
          Either all three access rights must be given to an
          identifier, or none of them. An attempt to add only one
          or two of these access rights will be rejected by the
          server.</p>

          <p>Other IMAP servers may have other restrictions on
          which combination of access rights are valid, or not.
          Depending on the server, the error message which rejects
          an invalid access rights combination may or may not be
          informative. Check the IMAP server's documentation for

        folders for certain tasks. Highlighting a folder, and
        pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>U</strong></span>
        (Use special) brings up the following prompt, which
        designates the highlighted folder as follows:</p>

        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>A</strong></span> - address

            <dd>
              <p><span class="application">Cone</span> can save its
              simple E-mail address book on a remote server, in
              addition to its local address book. POP3 mail folders
              cannot be used as remote address books, only IMAP or
              SMAP folders can do that. To create a new address
              book on a remote server, create a new IMAP or SMAP
              folder, highlight it with a cursor, and use this
              option.</p>

              <p>This option adds a new remote address book.
              <span class="application">Cone</span> can handle more
              than one address book, and E-mail addresses are
              looked up in each configured address book,
              sequentially, until the address is found.</p>

              <p><span class="application">Cone</span> can also
              search LDAP server-based address books. LDAP address
              books are added by choosing the &#8220;<span class="quote">Address Book</span>&#8221; option from the
              Main Menu.</p>

            <dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span> - draft</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>The draft folder is where new, unfinished
              messages, that have not been sent yet, are saved.
              Only one draft folder may be defined; selecting a new
              draft folder automatically unselects the previous
              draft folder.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> - sent
            mail</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This special folder contains saved copies of sent
              messages. Each time a message is sent, a copy is
              automatically placed into this folder, by
              default.</p>

              <p>This option adds a new sent mail folder.
              <span class="application">Cone</span> can handle more
              than one sent mail folder. When writing a new
              message, a sent mail folder may be selected where a

              sent.</p>

        </div>

        <p>IMPORTANT: a POP3 folder cannot be used as a special
        folder. Only IMAP, SMAP, or a local mail folder may be used
        as a special folder.</p>

        <p>IMPORTANT: do not delete a mail folder, or a mail
        account, that contains a special folder. Remove an existing
        address book using the &#8220;<span class="quote">Address
        Book</span>&#8221; selection from <span class="application">Cone</span>'s main menu. Remove an existing
        draft folder first by selecting a draft folder on a
        different mail account. Remove an existing sent-mail folder
        by choosing the &#8220;<span class="quote">Setup</span>&#8221; selection from <span class="application">Cone</span>'s main menu. Then, the folder or
        the account containing a special folder can be deleted.</p>

        <p>IMPORTANT: Do not open an address book folder, or a
        remote configuration folder manually, unless the remote
        IMAP/SMAP server allows concurrent access to the same
        folder. <span class="application">Cone</span> opens and
        closes these folders automatically, when needed. If the
        remote IMAP/SMAP server does not allow the same folder
        opened more than once, opening the folder manually will
        result in unpredictable errors.</p>

        <p>Use the cursor to highlight the name of a mail account,

        edit the mail account's configuration. This is primarily
        useful with remote mail accounts. There isn't much to do

        mail account, then add a new account that points to a

              unfinished messages in the Draft folder, before

              offers an option to resume writing an unfinished
              message, instead of starting a new message.
              <span class="application">Cone</span> automatically
              saves a backup copy of the current message being
              edited, at regular intervals, so that a backup copy
              can be recovered in the event that <span class="application">Cone</span> is interrupted, or
              terminated, in a middle of editing a new message. If
              a backup copy exists, <span class="application">Cone</span> announces the existence of
              an interrupted message, and prompts to resume writing
              the interrupted message. An interrupted message must
              be opened and either: sent, explicitly cancelled, or
              saved in the Draft folder; before another message can
