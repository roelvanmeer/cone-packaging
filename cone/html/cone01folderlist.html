The easiest way is to highlight an existing folder, then press
<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>U</B

CLASS="KEYCAP"
>T</B
>.
This folder is now included in the top-level folder list.
It is important to note that the actual mail folder is not renamed, or
otherwise moved in the mail account, it is only shown as part of the
default top-level folder hierarchy.
The top-level entry for this folder can be thought of as a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shortcut"</SPAN
> to the folder.
If the original folder is located deep in the mail account's folder hierarchy,
it is no longer necessary to dive deep into the hierarchy each time the
mail account is opened, in order to reach the folder; it's going to be
right there, in the top-level folder hierarchy.</P
><P
>Top-level folders do no appear in their original location in the mail
account's folder hierarchy.
When the folder is first added to the top-level folder list it momentarily
appears twice: in its actual location, on the screen, and at the topmost
level.
After its original hierarchy folder level is closed, it will no longer
appear.
As noted above, the folder is still there, it just appears as a shortcut
at the topmost level.
When the shortcut is removed (see the next section), the folder reappears
in its place.</P
><P
>The second way to create top-level folder shortcuts is to highlight the name
of the mail account with the cursor, then press
<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>A</B

<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT

>Add folder/directory in</TT
>
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>account</I
></TT
>"</SPAN
>.
Enter the complete folder name, as used by the mail account's server.
This method for adding top-level folders requires some knowledge of the
folder's location on the mail server.
However it can be used to add folders
that are outside of the currently-configured folder hierarchies
(which is sometimes the case with IMAP servers), as follows:</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>IMAP folders</DT

><P
>The folder name is used as is.
This means that folders whose names contain characters that are not in

<SPAN

Unicode/ISO-10646 characters that cannot be represented in the application's

in the folder name, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

><DD
><P
>Usenet accounts already have a dedicated link to subscribed newsgroups.
For Usenet accounts, this process is used to subscribe to a new newsgroup
which does not appear under "All newsgroups".</P
><P
>It is not possible for NetNews (Usenet) readers to maintain a correct,
accurate list of available newsgroups.
Usenet readers must download a list of available newsgroups, which can be
quite large and require a significant time to download.
It's not feasible to do this every time.
As such, Usenet readers keep a saved copy of the download newsgroup list.
Upon request, the newsgroup list may be downloaded again, and the locally
saved list is brought up to date.
This is what "Refresh newsgroup list" does.</P
><P
>"Check for new newsgroups" is a partial solution that's supported by most
Usenet news servers, and can usually do the trick and download recently
added newsgroups.
There's no way to remove newsgroups no longer carried by the server, except
by using "Refresh newsgroup list", but at least "Check for new newsgroups"
will do the trick and include new groups under "All newsgroups", so that they
can be subscribed to.</P
><P
>However, sometimes "Refresh newsgroup list" might not work with some oddball
news server, or the news server can accidentally lose its wits and "forget"
which new newsgroups were added, recently.
In any case, use
the process for creating a top-level folder in order to manually subscribe
to a newsgroup.
Type in the newsgroup's name, carefully checking for the correct spelling.
After creating a link, open it and the newsgroup will now be subscribed to,
and it will now appear under "Subscribed newsgroups".</P

Additionally, some IMAP servers are limited in the combination of access
rights that may be given to an identifier.
For example, IMAP servers that implement version 1 of the access control
list protocol can only assign the <SPAN

Either all three access rights must be given to an identifier, or none of
them.
An attempt to add only one or two of these access rights will be rejected
by the server.</P

>Other IMAP servers may have other restrictions on which combination of
access rights are valid, or not.
Depending on the server, the error message which rejects an invalid access
rights combination may or may not be informative.
