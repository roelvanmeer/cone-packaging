    <p>The rest of this document defines the actual SMAP commands,
    but all commands from the client, and replies from the server,
    follow the same basic syntax. All SMAP commands, and replies,
    use the UTF-8 character set (no matter what the natural
    language is used for error messages, or prompts). An SMAP
    command is generally one or more words. The words are separated
    by at least one whitespace character (U+0020, U+0009, or
    U+000D). An SMAP command is terminated by the newline
    character, (U+000A).</p>

    <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
      <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

      <p>The server does not translate actual message contents to
      UTF-8. The server provides the contents of a message as is,
      to the client. The UTF-8 character set is used for:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>Names of folders</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Error and status messages</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Search strings</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Other text-based entities already use an implicit
      character set (such as US-ASCII for names of E-mail headers)
      or are specified as opaque text strings (such as message
      unique identifiers, loginid and password) and have no
      explicitly defined character set.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

      <p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt" target="_top" shape="rect">RFC 2822</a> sets the maximum length of a line
      in an E-mail message as 998 characters. This limitation is
      applicable to SMAP, since SMAP deals with E-mail.
      Additionally, SMAP commands may not exceed 8000 characters.
      SMAP servers should accept commands up to 8000 characters
      long. SMAP clients should not send commands that exceed 8000
      characters in length.</p>

      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

        <p>This, of course, does not apply to binary-formatted
        multiline replies, that transfer binary MIME
        attachments.</p>
      </div>

      <p>SMAP servers should terminate inactive SMAP clients. SMAP
      servers must have a timeout of at least 30 minutes. SMAP
      clients must not wait more than 29 minutes before sending the
      next command to the server. SMAP clients that must remain
      idle for a prolonged period of time should periodically send
      the <code class="literal">NOOP</code> command to prevent
      themselves from being disconnected for inactivity.</p>
    </div>

      <p>A word can contain any character except for a control
      character (U+0000 through U+001F). If a word contains spaces
      or quotes (U+0020 or U+0022), a quote must be added before
      the first character of the word, and a second quote character
      must follow the last character of the word. Quotes that are
      part of the word are doubled. For example: <code class="literal">"Learning the ""ABC""'s"</code> is a single SMAP
      word. The word contains a single quote character before the
      letter "A" and a second quote character after the letter "C".
      Everything else is as it appears. A word that contains a
      single quote character is represented as <code class="literal">""""</code>. A word that's meant to be completely
      empty is represented by two quotes: <code class="literal">""</code>.</p>
    </div>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>SMAP server replies also (except where noted) are lines of
      text terminated by U+000A. There are three general classes of
      server replies. All three of them generally contain either
      whitespace-delimited words (formatted similarly), or they
      begin with one or more whitespace-delimited words, with the
      rest being an informative, free-form message.</p>

      <p>SMAP servers are allowed to reply with lines of text
      terminated by the CR+LF sequence, U+000D U+000A. The ASCII CR
      character is interpreted by SMAP clients as whitespace
      filler, and is generally ignored. SMAP servers must be
      prepared to receive client commands that use either the CR+LF
      or the bare LF newline sequence. The only exception to this
      rule is the initial connection negotiation, which must use
      CR+LF in order to remain compatible with IMAP.</p>

      <p>An SMAP client receives the server's response by reading
      an entire U+000A-terminated line, then parsing the first
      word, or character, to determine the reply's format.</p>
    </div>

          </div>

      <p>A line whose first word is either &#8220;<span class="quote">+OK</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="quote">-ERR</span>&#8221; is a &#8220;<span class="quote">status reply</span>&#8221;. &#8220;<span class="quote">+OK</span>&#8221; indicates that the client's request
      succeeded, &#8220;<span class="quote">-ERR</span>&#8221;
      indicates that it failed. The rest of the line is a free-form
      message, suitable to be displayed as the original command's
      acknowledgement. The status reply does not include any actual
      information requested by the original command (if any). The
      status reply indicates whether the command succeeded or
      failed. Information requested by the original command will be
      sent before the status reply, using either a "single line",
      or a "multiple line" format (see below). A command can result
      in more than one single or multi-line reply. The client,
      after sending an SMAP command, keeps reading single and
      multi-line replies, until a final status reply is read. After
      receiving the status reply, the client may proceed to send
      the next server command.</p>

      <p>The SMAP client must wait until the status reply is
      received before sending the next command.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

        <p>In order to allow interoperability with IMAP, server
        replies prior to logging in are an exception to this reply
        format. They follow the general IMAP syntax.</p>
      </div>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>A server reply where the first whitespace-delimited word
      is the &#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221; character
      is called a &#8220;<span class="quote">single line
      reply</span>&#8221;. Single line replies send information,
      requested by the original command, formatted as
      whitespace-delimited words. The information carried by the
      words depends on the reply. The actual format of a single
      line reply depends on the original command, but can usually
      be determined by the word that follows &#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221;. This single-line reply does not
      indicate if the client's command succeeded, the client must
      still wait to receive the final status reply. The only
      exception to this rule is the initial connection greeting, or
      the unexpected connection termination situation, which is
      described later.</p>

      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

        <p>The client must be prepared to receive multiple single
        line and multiple line replies, followed by an
        &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">-ERR</code></span>&#8221; status reply. This
        happens when the server encounters an error in a middle of
        processing the client's request.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <div class="titlepage">
        <div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="title"><a id="multiline" shape="rect" name="multiline"> </a>Multiple line replies</h4>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Certain information returned by an SMAP server cannot be
      conveniently represented as a single line of text. An example
      would be the contents of a message. Obviously, messages
      contains many lines of text. A server reply whose first word
      starts with the '{' character is called a &#8220;<span class="quote">multiple line reply</span>&#8221;. This name is
      actually slightly misleading; this format may carry binary
      data that bears no resemblance to lines of text.</p>

      <p>There are two separate multi-line reply formats. The first
      format is suitable for line-oriented textual content. It's
      called the &#8220;<span class="quote">dot-stuffed
      format</span>&#8221;. The first word of the server reply is
      &#8220;<span class="quote">{.<em class="replaceable"><code>nnnn</code></em>}</span>&#8221;, where
      &#8220;<span class="quote"><em class="replaceable"><code>nnnn</code></em></span>&#8221; is a
      decimal number. This number is the server's estimate of the
      total size of the multi-line reply, in bytes. It is not an
      exact byte count, just a reasonable estimate. The server is
      not required to compute the exact byte count before sending
      the data, just provide a ballpark estimate.</p>

      <p>The remaining words of the server's multi-line reply line
      contain other information, depending on the nature of the
      data. For example, a single SMAP command can request the
      server to return the contents of two or more messages. The
      server may process those messages in any order. The remainder
      of the server's multi-line reply line indicates which message
      this multi-line reply refers to. The actual data follows the
      server's multi-line reply line. The data is transmitted as
      lines of text, each line terminated by the U+000A character.
      Servers are also allowed to use the U+000D/U+000A end-of-line
      sequence. The end of the data is marked by a line that
      contains only a single period, U+002E, followed by optional
      whitespace. Lines of data that begin with U+002E have a
      second U+002E character prepended.</p>

      <p>An SMAP client, upon receiving a multi-line reply in this
      format, begins reading U+000A-terminated lines of text, until
      it reads a line containing a single U+002E, and optional
      whitespace. Other lines with a leading U+002E character have
      it removed, and the rest of the line gets saved as the
      returned data.</p>

      <p>The second multi-line server reply format carries binary
      data. It begins with the word &#8220;<span class="quote">{<em class="replaceable"><code>xxxx</code></em>/<em class="replaceable"><code>yyyy</code></em>}</span>&#8221;, where
      &#8220;<span class="quote"><em class="replaceable"><code>xxxx</code></em></span>&#8221; and
      &#8220;<span class="quote"><em class="replaceable"><code>yyyy</code></em></span>&#8221; are
      decimal numbers. &#8220;<span class="quote"><em class="replaceable"><code>yyyy</code></em></span>&#8221; gives the
      server's estimate of the total size of the binary data, and
      &#8220;<span class="quote"><em class="replaceable"><code>xxxx</code></em></span>&#8221; gives the
      byte count of the first part that the server is about to
      send. The server does not have to send everything as one
      binary goop. The server is allowed to break down the binary
      data in smaller, managable, chunks, which are sent one at a
      time.</p>

      <p>The remaining words of the multi-line reply line format
      are the same as as the dot-stuffed format's. Immediately
      following the multi-line reply's trailing U+000A, the server
      sends exactly the number of bytes given by <em class="replaceable"><code>xxxx</code></em>. This is called a
      "binary chunk".</p>

      <p>Each binary chunk is followed by another line of text
      terminated by the U+000A character. A trailing line that's
      empty, or contains only whitespace, indicates the end of the
      multi-line binary data. Otherwise the line contains a single
      word, <em class="replaceable"><code>xxxx</code></em> (which
      can have leading or trailing whitespace filler), that gives
      the byte count of the next binary chunk, which immediately
      follows the U+000A character.</p>

      <p>The SMAP client reads the initial multi-line reply line,
      and obtains the first chunk's byte count, and the estimated
      total byte count. The SMAP client then reads the exact number
      of bytes indicated by the byte count. Afterwords, the SMAP
      client enters a loop where it first reads a
      newline-terminated line of text. If the line is empty or
      contains only whitespace filler, then this is the end of the
      binary data, and the client proceeds to read the next server
      reply. Otherwise the client extracts the next chunk's byte
      count, reads the indicated number of bytes, then repeats the
      process.</p>
    </div>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>An expected multi-line reply may be empty. An example: the
      client requests specific E-mail headers, but the message does
      not have them. This is indicated by an empty multi-line
      reply. An empty multi-line reply is indicated by the word
      "{.0}" (followed by the remaining words that specify the
      context of this multi-line reply). The next line sent by the
      server contains a single "." character. This sequence is
      parsed by an SMAP client as a completely empty multi-line
      reply.</p>
