    <p>This is a simple, automatic mail processing function. In
    this context, &#8220;<span class="quote">mail
    filtering</span>&#8221; means the ability to move,
    automatically delete, or automatically flag all messages that
    match a specific search criteria.</p>

    <p>Where possible, it is always more efficient to have the mail
    server filter messages, instead of a mail client like
    <span class="application">Cone</span>. <span class="application">Cone</span> mail filters may prove to be
    sufficient if the mail server does not mail filtering
    abilities. In situations where the mail server is capable of
    filtering, the mail server's filters will usually be faster and
    more efficient.</p>

    <p>Mail filters may be used with any IMAP, <a class="link" href="smap1.html" title="Appendix&#160;A.&#160;Simple Mail Access Protocol, Version 1" shape="rect">SMAP</a>, or a local mail account. Mail filters
    may also be used with POP3 accounts, but they'll be slow, and
    they'll have certain limitations. <span class="application">Cone</span> will have to download a copy of every
    message in the POP3 mailbox, in order to check it against the
    searching criteria, for every mail filter search. This is not
    needed with IMAP/SMAP accounts, where the search request is
    processed by the mail server.</p>

    <p>Mail filters may also be used in limited ways with Usenet
    newsgroups. Only limited forms of searching are available: only
    Usenet message headers may be searched, and the searching
    criteria may only include English characters. All other search
    requests can only be met by downloading a copy of every message
    from the newsgroup, which is not going to work very well, for
    obvious reasons.</p>

    <p>The best use for mail filters with a Usenet newsgroup is as
    a simple killfile: &#8220;<span class="quote">Search From:
    contains troll@example.com</span>&#8221;, followed by
    &#8220;<span class="quote">Delete and
    Expunge</span>&#8221;.</p>

    <p>A mail filter may be installed for any folder. Each folder
    has its own mail filters. The folder's mail filter is
    automatically processed by <span class="application">Cone</span> whenever:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>The folder is opened for the first time, or reopened
          after another folder was opened.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>New messages are added to the folder.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>All messages in the folder are processed by the mail filters
    when the folder is opened. When new messages are added to the
    folder, only the new messages will be processed by the mail
    filters. Existing messages will be ignored.</p>

      <p>This screen is accessed by highlighting a folder on the
      Folder Listing screen, then pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>F</strong></span>. Each mail filter consists
      of one or more &#8220;<span class="quote">steps</span>&#8221;. There are two kinds of steps: a
      &#8220;<span class="quote">select</span>&#8221; step compiles
      a list of messages that match a certain search criteria; the
      selection step is followed by one or more steps that apply a
      particular &#8220;<span class="quote">action</span>&#8221;
      against all messages that were selected. More than one action
      step may follow a selection step; messages are processed by
      each action step in sequence, until another selection step,
      which searches the remaining messages again, and compiles a
      different list of selected messages.</p>

      <p>Some actions cannot be naturally followed by any other
      action, and can only be followed by another selection step.
      Consider, for example, &#8220;<span class="quote">Delete And
      Expunge</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="quote">Move to
      another folder</span>&#8221; filtering step: at the
      conclusion the selected messages are obviously removed, and
      nothing else can be done with them, any more.</p>

      <p>This screen initially shows any existing filtering steps
      defined for the folder. All filtering steps are processed in
      the order shown. Highlighting an existing filtering step and
      pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>CTRL</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>U</strong></span>, or <span class="keycap"><strong>CTRL</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span>, moves the filtering step
      higher or lower, thus changing its relative order in the mail
      filter. <span class="keycap"><strong>DEL</strong></span>
      removes the existing filtering step. The folder's mail filter
      is removed by highlighting each step and pressing
      <span class="keycap"><strong>DEL</strong></span>, then
      highlighting &#8220;<span class="quote">Save
      Filters</span>&#8221; and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span>.</p>

      <p>All changes made on this screen are temporary.
      &#8220;<span class="quote">Save Filters</span>&#8221; must be
      selected in order for any changes made on this screen to take
      effect. <span class="keycap"><strong>CTRL</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>C</strong></span> closes this screen without
      changing the folder's existing filter, throwing out all the
      temporary changes.</p>

      <p>Highlighting &#8220;<span class="quote">Add new
      filter</span>&#8221; and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span> adds a new filtering
      step to the end of the mail filter. A sub-menu is shown to
      define the new filtering step:</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Move the selected messages to another folder.
            Selecting this option reopens the folder index screen.
            Highlight the folder where the messages can be moved
            to, and press ENTER.</p>

            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
              <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

              <p>Messages can be moved only to folders in the same
              mail account. Messages cannot be moved to a folder in
              another mail account.</p>

              <p>This means that this option is not available with
              POP3 accounts, which naturally have only one
              folder.</p>

          <dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>C</strong></span> - copy

          <dd>
            <p>Copies the selected messages to another folder. This
            is very similar to the move command, except copies of
            the selected messages remain in the original
            folder.</p>

            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
              <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

              <p>This mail filter will be processed every time a
              folder is opened. Therefore, the selected messages
              will be copied to another folder every time this
              folder is opened. This Copy filtering step should be
              followed by another filtering step, such as Move, or
              Delete/Expunge, that removes all selected messages.
              Otherwise the results could be quite amusing</p>

            <p>Efficient searching is implemented for local mail,
            and IMAP/SMAP mailboxes only. NetNews servers'
            searching capabilities are very limited, and POP3
            servers have no search facilities whatsoever. In all
            cases, searching for message status flags is supported,
            since message status flags are always cached
            locally.</p>

            <p>Only message headers of NetNews folders may be
            searched, and only English characters can be used as a
            search string. Some older NetNews servers may not have
            any searching ability whatsoever. Searching of message
            contents is not supported. Searching by message size,
            or message's date is not supported either.</p>

            <p>Searching of POP3 folders is also not very
            efficient, although the search text is not limited to
            English characters only. POP3 folder search is
            accomplished by downloading the complete headers of
            each message, and searching it manually. Downloaded
            headers are not cached. The headers are also downloaded
            when searching by message's date. Searching by message
            size, or message's date is not supported for POP3
            folders.</p>
