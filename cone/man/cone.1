.HP \w'\fBcone\fR\ 'u

.SH "USAGE"
.PP

Cone
is a console newsreader and E\-mail\&. It is an interactive program for reading and sending E\-mail messages\&.
Cone
is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn\&. Starting
Cone
for the first time displays two links: one for the default system mailbox, and a second link to a quick online tutorial\&. The online tutorial provides a brief overview of using
Cone
for reading and sending E\-mail\&.
.PP
Pressing
Q
on most screens exits
Cone\&.
Cone
tries to gracefully log out and shut down all server connections\&. If
Cone
cannot log out of a remote server because the remote server is down, press
CTRL\-C
(after
Q
to terminate
Cone)\&.
.PP
Use
CTRL\-Z
to temporarily suspend
Cone
and drop back to the shell prompt\&.
Cone
remains suspended in the background, and may be restarted by using the shell\'s
\fBfg\fR
command\&.

.PP
Connections to remote mail servers may be disconnected for inactivity if
Cone
remains suspended for a prolonged period of time\&. When suspended,
Cone
cannot maintain any active connections to remote mail servers\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
The
\fB\-c\fR
option names a directory where
Cone
saves its configuration files, and defaults to
$HOME/\&.cone\&. The configuration directory will be created, if necessary\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-r\fR
option recovers a backup copy of
Cone\'s configuration file\&. This option is primarily used when remote configuration is enabled, but the folder that contains
Cone\'s configuration on a remote server was deleted, or is not available\&. In all cases,
Cone
makes a daily local configuration file backup\&. The
\fB\-r\fR
option searches for local configuration file backups, and offers an option to restore the backup copy\&.
.SS "Reading local mail with Cone"
.PP

Cone
reads local mail from either maildirs (the preferred format) or mailbox files (or "mboxes")\&. When mboxes are used,
Cone
does not read the system mailbox file directly (usually
/var/spool/\fIsomething\fR)\&. All messages in the system mailbox are automatically moved to
$HOME/Inbox, which is then accessed as if it was the system mailbox\&. Starting
Cone
for the first time on an mbox\-based system automatically copies all existing mail from the system mailbox file to
$HOME/Inbox\&.
.PP
This is an intentional design choice\&. Normal user application cannot create new files in
/var/spool; all they can do is read the mailbox file from
/var/spool\&. Therefore, the only way to update the mailbox file is by rewriting it from scratch (more or less)\&. While the mailbox file is in the process of being rewritten, if the
Cone
process is interrupted, or killed, the resulted in a corrupted system mailbox\&. There are way to minimize this vulnerability, but it cannot be eliminated completely\&. Some Linux kernels use an
\(lqOOM killer\(rq
that may terminate any process when the system memory is low\&. There is no way to completely prevent corrupted system mailbox files on those kernels\&.
.PP

Cone
uses an alternative way of updating mboxes\&.
Cone
updates mboxes by creating a new mbox file separately, then replacing the original mbox file with the new version\&. Unfortunately this cannot be done with the system mailbox file, because of the restricted access rights on the system spool directory\&. To solve this problem
Cone
automatically copies the system mailbox file to
$HOME/Inbox, each time the system mailbox file is opened and whenever new mail is available\&.
.SS "Viewing MIME attachments"
.PP

Cone
displays text and simple HTML content by itself\&. Other kinds of attachments may be viewed by using a helper script\&.
Cone
invokes a helper script to open a MIME attachment\&. The helper script\'s name is
\(lq\fITYPE\fR\&.\fISUBTYPE\fR\&.filter\(rq, where
\(lqTYPE\(rq
and
\(lqSUBTYPE\(rq
corresponds to the MIME type and subtype, accordingly\&.
Cone
looks for helper scripts in
$HOME/\&.cone
(or the directory specified by
\fB\-c\fR) and in
@datadir@/cone\&.
.PP
For example, a helper script named
\(lqIMAGE\&.GIF\&.filter\(rq, if installed, is invoked to process
image/gif
MIME attachments\&.

\fBHelper scripts\fR
.RS 4
.PP

Cone
runs each helper script twice:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
TYPE\&.SUBTYPE\&.filter check \fItype/subtype\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
When the first argument is
\(lqcheck\(rq, the helper script should terminate with a zero exit code if it is willing to process an attachment whose MIME type is specified by the second argument\&. A script or a program that\'s has multiple
\(lqTYPE\&.SUBTYPE\&.filter\(rq
links may use the second argument to identify the attachment\'s mime type\&. If the helper script is unable to process the attachment, at this time, it should terminate with a non\-zero exit code\&.
.PP
The default helper script for image attachments terminates with a non\-zero exit code if the
\fBDISPLAY\fR
environment variable is not initialized\&. When invoked from an X\-Windows terminal, image attachments will be automatically displayed; and image attachments are ignored otherwise on non\-graphical consoles\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
TYPE\&.SUBTYPE\&.filter filter \fItype/subtype\fR \fIfilename\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If the helper script initially terminates with a zero exit code, it will be invoked again after the MIME attachment is downloaded and decoded\&. The first argument will be
\(lqfilter\(rq, and the attachment\'s filename is specified by the third argument\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
This is a temporary file, whose extension will not necessary be the file extension associated with this MIME type\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
The helper script should read and process the file specified by the third argument\&.
Cone
interprets anything the helper script writes to standard output as HTML\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP

Cone
waits until the helper script terminates before displaying the rest of the message\&. Most helper scripts should run in the background\&. However, note that
Cone
removes the temporary file when the original message is closed; the temporary file may be removed any time after the helper script terminates\&. The helper script should make its own private copy of the file, if necessary\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.SS "Activating URLs"
.PP

Cone
has limited ability to activate
URLs in
HTML
messages\&.
Cone
handles
\(lqmailto:\(rq
URLs by itself\&. For other
URLs
Cone
runs
@datadir@/cone/\fImethod\fR\&.handler
with the
URL
passed as an argument\&.
.PP

Cone
installs
http\&.handler
(hard linked to
https\&.handler)\&. This script checks if
firefox
or
mozilla
binaries are found in the current
\fBPATH\fR, and runs them\&.

Cone
also looks
