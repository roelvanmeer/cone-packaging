.SH NAME
leaf \- Lightweight Editor of Ascii(and more) Files
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBleaf\fR [ \fB-d \fIdictionary\fB\fR ] [ \fB+\fIn\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fIfilename\fB\fR ]

.SH "USAGE"
.PP
\fBleaf\fR is a simple console text file editor, with
paragraph word-wrapping and spell checking.
\fBleaf\fR is based on the text editor in the \fBCone\fR
mail reader and composer.
\fBleaf\fR opens \fIfilename\fR, position
the cursor on the first line, or line #\fIn\fR,
if specified.
.PP
This is not really the best editor for program sources.
\fBleaf\fR is meant to be used as a quick editor for writing
short notes and memos.
As text is typed, words will automatically flow to wrap within a typical
80-character terminal display, even on larger display (due to
\fBleaf\fR\&'s heritage as an editor for E-mail messages, which
are traditionally formatted to fit an 80-character display).
Word wrapping is "lazy": only long text lines are wrapped.
Short text lines are not folded together.
Individual paragraphs are separated by blank lines of text.
Press \fBCTRL\fR-\fBJ\fR to optimally
rewrap the paragraph under the cursor.
The bottom two lines on the screen list which keys to press for other
functions.
.PP
The \fB-d\fR sets the name of the dictionary used for spell
checking (overriding the default spell checking dictionary set by the
\fBDICTIONARY\fR environment variable).
\fB+\fIn\fB\fR sets the initial cursor
position to line #\fIn\fR\&.
