.SH "USAGE"
.PP
This function implements folder access control lists (ACLs)\. Access control lists define who is allowed to do certain operations on a folder, or on messages in the folder\. Folder ACLs are implement only for IMAP accounts on IMAP servers that implement access control lists\. This function will fail if
\fIfolder\fR
is not a folder on an IMAP server that supports access control lists\.
.PP
This function computes application\'s access rights on the
\fIfolder\fR\. If this function succeeds (this function may fail if the requesting client does not have the required access to the folder),
\fIrights\fR
will be initialized by a text string that contains a list of character which describe the requested client\'s access rights on the folder\.
.PP
At this time, the following access rights are supported:
.PP
\(lqa\(rq

\(lqi\(rq
.RS 4
Insert, or add messages to the folder\.
.RE
.PP
\(lql\(rq
.RS 4
List, or view the folder\'s existence\. If a folder does not have the
\(lql\(rq
access right, the server will not include this folder when it\'s asked to list all folders in the folder directory\. However, if the
\(lqr\(rq
access right is present, the folder may be opened if the folder\'s name is known\.
.RE
.PP
\(lqr\(rq
.RS 4
Read, or open the folder\. An attempt to open the folder will fail without the
\(lqr\(rq
access right, even if the folder\'s name is known\.
.RE
.PP
\(lqp\(rq
.RS 4

\(lqPost messages\(rq
to the folder\. This access right is currently listed in the ACL specification; however its intention is not clear, and most servers do not do anything useful with this access right\. It is listed here for information purposes only\.
.RE
.PP
\(lqs\(rq
.RS 4
Allow changing the read/unread status of messages in the folder\. The server will not automatically clear the
unread
message status flag on messages after they are read, or let this status flag be explicitly changed, without the
\(lqs\(rq
access right\.
.RE
.PP
\(lqt\(rq
.RS 4
Allow tagging of messages as deleted or undeleted\. The server will prohibit changing the messages\'
deleted
message status flag without the
\(lqt\(rq
access right\.
.RE
.PP
\(lqw\(rq
.RS 4
Allow changing the
draft,
replied, and
marked
message status flags\. The server will not allow changes to these flags without the
\(lqw\(rq
access right\.
.RE
.PP
\(lqx\(rq
.RS 4
Allow this folder to be removed\. The server will not this folder to be deleted without the
\(lqx\(rq
access right\.
