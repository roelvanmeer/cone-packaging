   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                Installing Cone

   First, make sure that all the necessary requirements (README) are
   satisfied. See RPM instructions below if building for Red Hat Linux. See
   additional notes below for upgrade instructions. Otherwise:

     * Download the Courier Socks 5 proxy client library from
       http://www.courier-mta.org/download.php#sox and follow its
       installation instructions. Binary RPMs can be built from the source
       code tarball by following the procedure outlined in
       http://www.courier-mta.org/FAQ.html#rpm using the
       "courier-sox-version" tarball, and installing the "courier-sox" and
       "courier-sox-devel" binary RPMs afterwards.

       This step can be omitted if Socks 5 support is not required. Cone will
       compile without the Socks 5 proxy toolkit.

     * Download the source code tarball from
       http://www.courier-mta.org/download.php#cone and unpack it.

     * Set the appropriate environment variables if the compiler or linker
       needs any custom command line flags. Run "./configure --help" to list
       the available environment variables that specify additional arbitrary
       parameters for the C/C++ compiler.

     * Run "./configure [options]". See below for a list of available
       options.

     * Run make.

       NOTE: The GNU version of the command is required. On BSD
             systems it's the gmake. Use gmake in this, and the
             following steps.

     * Run make check.

     * Run make install.

     * Run make install-configure.

   NOTE: Do not forget "make install-configure". It is required.

   Unless other options are used, Cone installs in /usr/local:

   /usr/local/etc

           The configuration file.

   /usr/local/bin

           The shell script that runs Cone.

   /usr/local/libexec

           The Cone program itself.

   /usr/local/share

           Documentation, online help, other files.

   /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include

           The development libraries and include files (only if --with-devel
           was specified to the configure script).

   These installation directories, and other options, may be controlled by
   additional options to the configure script:

   --prefix, --bindir, and others...

           ./configure --help lists about a dozen parameters to the
           ./configure that specify the directories where various files
           should be installed.

   --with-certdb, --without-certdb, --with-certdb=filename

           Install or do not install a default set of trusted SSL certificate
           authorities. When using SSL Cone normally checks the server's SSL
           certificate, which must be signed by a trusted certificate
           authority. Cone's source distribution includes the same list of
           trusted certificate authorities as the Mozilla browser. Cone's
           certificate list is installed by default, unless Courier is also
           installed, in which case Cone';s default configuration points to
           Courier's rootcerts directory (which contains the same certificate
           as Cone's).

           --with-certdb installs Cone's trusted SSL certificate authority
           list, even if Courier is also installed, in
           /usr/local/share/cone/rootcerts (which is derived from the
           --datadir default option, as explained by ./configure --help).
           --with-certdb=filename installs the trusted SSL certificate
           authority list in the directory filename. --without-certdb does
           not install Cone's trusted SSL certificate authority list.

   --with-devel

           Install  LibMAIL, the mail library used by Cone to access and
           handle E-mail messages.

   --with-spellcheck=pspell

           Cone can use either aspell or pspell for spell checking. aspell is
           used if both are installed. This option selects pspell instead.

Upgrading from an earlier version of Cone

   Upgrading Cone consists simply of building the new version, and installing
   it. The new version will overwrite the previous version. Special upgrade
   instructions are given below.

  Upgrading from version 0.59 and earlier

   The address book format has changed in version 0.60. The old address book
   format will be automatically converted to the new format, when necessary,
   so no manual intervention is necessary. If Cone is later downgraded to an
   earlier version, addresses in an address book that contain non-English
   characters will not be shown correctly.

RPM builds

   Red Hat 9, and earlier does not have a wide-character enabled curses
   library. Use the following procedure to build Cone with full UTF-8
   support.

   The first step is to create a work area for building RPMs. Skip this step
   if an RPM build directory is already configured.

   echo "%_topdir    $HOME/rpm" > $HOME/.rpmmacros
   mkdir $HOME/rpm
   cd $HOME/rpm
   mkdir SOURCES SPECS BUILD SRPMS RPMS

   NOTE: For Red Hat 9, and earlier:
         Download the source RPM for ncurses 5.3 from
         http://www.courier-mta.org/beta/ncurses/. This custom RPM does not
         replace the existing version of curses shipped by Red Hat, and will
         not affect any existing software. It does not replace the Red
         Hat-shipped package, only installs an alternative version of curses.

         Run "rpm -i filename" to install the source RPM in the RPM build
         directory. Go to the SPECS directory, where the file
         ncurses-compat.spec is now installed, and run "rpmbuild -ba
         ncurses-compat.spec".

         The build script creates two binary RPMS: ncurses53 and
         ncurses53-devel. Use "rpm -i" to install both packages, as root.

         Fedora Core 1 includes a wide-character version of ncurses; and does
         not need the custom ncurses build.

   Finally, download the source code to Cone from
   http://www.courier-mta.org/download.php#cone. Do not unpack the tarball.
   Execute "rpmbuild -ta cone-version.tar.bz2". Two binary RPMs will be
   created: the main binary package contains Cone. The "devel" package
   contains the LibMAIL library and development files. It is only necessary
   to install the main package to run Cone the "devel" subpackage is only
   needed for additional development with LibMAIL .

CVS Source checkouts

   It is also possible to check out the source from CVS, however additional
   requirements apply. Besides the usual prerequisites for building Cone,
   additional development software must be installed. See the "Download via
   CVS" instructions at http://www.courier-mta.org/status.html. Cone has the
   same requirements as Courier for CVS builds (technically, Cone does not
   need libtool, but that may change in the future). Make sure that the
   prerequisite software is installed, then check out the "Cone" module from
   CVS, tagged at revision "Cone-latest". The HEAD may be checked out, but
   carries more of the usual risks.

   After the module is checked out, run the autobloat shell script to rebuild
   the autoconf/automake scripts.
